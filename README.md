Username="test" and password= "test".
  For the login operation there is a users table which stores username and password. Normally passwords should be stored as encrypted(MD5 etc.) but I stored the password without encryption for saving some time

  There is a login screen which allows users to login to the system. There is no registration page so I added the user records manually to the database

  After successful login, the main page comes up.  In this page there is a sub menu located on the left side of the screen. Users can navigate between different components with this sub menu. For now the data displayed in the grid are static so that it is not connected to a database but it can be done easily in the future.
